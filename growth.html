        <div class="pe"> <p> I gave my all and all when I started in my early age,
             my energy my day and night I gave it all for the love of what I do best. 
            In the year 1999 where I met a young copper whose name was Lily,
             she was tall and slim with brown eyes this lady taught me how to survive in the jungle 
             meanwhile I was in 200 level computer science at university of nsukka Nigeria. 
             The young lady Lily taught me so many things to do as an entrepreneur she is she taught me how to be a CEO 
             of a company which I am today I took her class for a straight two years learning at the end of that 
             training I was already in my finals (year 4). Then I told her that I could not continue as a CEO 
             because of my exams and projects then she gave me reasons why I should be humble and courageous to
              continue the process of learning how to be a CEO then suddenly I shouted at her and told her that
               I'm not interested again then she smiled and apologized to me for teaching me at the first place.
            In the year 2002 I was done with uni then my mother sent me to Abuja for holiday I stayed in Abuja 
            for two good years and finally came back during the Year 2004 24th October that was when I was told to come
             and prepare for nysc program
             I felt happy and I was so overjoyed without knowing I'm entering hell. 
            It is already 3rd January 2005 at 6:00 p.m. I was on my way to IMo state where I will serve my country
             this is where the hell began the road of imo is so bad to the extent our bus had to stop on the road
              and we started looking for help around 8:00 p.m. to God be the Glory we reached imo  around 10:00 p.m. 
              what a day.
            It is already 3rd January 2005 at 6:00 p.m. I was on my way to IMo state where I will serve my country 
            this is where the hell began the road of imo is so bad to the extent our bus had to stop on the road and 
            we started looking for help around 8:00 p.m. to God be the Glory we reached imo  around 10:00 p.m. what a day.
            
            After four months of serving in IMO I noticed that I have suddenly run dry I was totally out of cash
             then I thought of what to do at that point I remembered a girl called Lily who was a copper like me when 
             I was still in year 2 so I quickly checked my phone and noticed that her number cannot be found in my 
             contacts again I cried bitterly after some days I decided to go for a walk on my way coming back I bump 
             into four groups of girls who were looking for a teacher to teach them how to create a website this girls
              were in their year 2 just like me their names were kammy, bami, ola and funke. So I quickly offered to teach
               them and then I get paid they all agreed so it got to a point ola said to me ma isn't it better you do it 
               and get paid at that point I felt loved then I was taking to the vice chancellor of the school to show him
                my work, my design the man out of his love and care he gave me a reward of 1 million naira  and also
                 offered me a job in his school to show me more appreciation.
            As I worked temporarily during the students week of the university I was among the lecturers that was given
             award for their contribution in his University, at this point in my life I really wished Lily was there with
              me to experience her hard work, to my greatest surprise ola was Lily's cousin.
            As soon as I heard that ola was Lily's cousin I rushed out for her and give her a warm hug and gladly told her
             to please give me Lily's number that I would like to speak with her so ola said no problem  I'll give you the
              number, after a while she came back, give me the number I called the lady and to my greatest surprise lily
               was in America with her two beautiful babies then I really thank her and told her all the news and 
               everything and then she wowed and congratulated me for picking up her advice after school and that 
               was how I became a CEO of jimka enterprise.
