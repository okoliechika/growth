            In the year 1999 where I met a young copper whose name was Micheal,
             he was tall and slim with brown eyes this young man taught me how to survive in the jungle 
             meanwhile I was in 200 level computer enrg. at university of kaduna Nigeria. 
             The young man  taught me so many things to do as an entrepreneur he taught me how to be a CEO 
             of a company which I am today I took his class for a straight two years learning at the end of that 
             training I was already in my finals (year 4). Then I told him that I could not continue as a CEO 
             because of my exams and projects then he gave me reasons why I should be humble and courageous to
              continue the process of learning how to be a CEO then suddenly I shouted at him and told him that
               I'm not interested again then he smiled and apologized to me for teaching me at the first place.
            In the year 2002 I was done with uni then my father sent me to Abuja for holiday I stayed in Abuja 
            for two good years and finally came back during the Year 2004 24th October that was when I was told to come
             and prepare for nysc program
             I felt happy and I was so overjoyed without knowing I'm entering hell. 
            It is already 3rd January 2005 at 6:00 p.m. I was on my way to LAGOS state where I will serve my country
             this is where the hell began the road of LAGOS is so bad to the extent our bus had to stop on the road
              and we started looking for help around 8:00 p.m. to God be the Glory we reached  around 10:00 p.m. 
              what a day.
            It is already 3rd January 2005 at 6:00 p.m. I was on my way to LAGOS state where I will serve my country 
            this is where the hell began the road of LAGOS is so bad to the extent our bus had to stop on the road and 
            we started looking for help around 8:00 p.m. to God be the Glory we reached around 10:00 p.m. what a day.
            
            After four months of serving in LAGOS I noticed that I have suddenly run dry I was totally out of cash
             then I thought of what to do at that point I remembered a man called Micheal who was a copper like me when 
             I was still in year 2 so I quickly checked my phone and noticed that his number cannot be found in my 
             contacts again I cried bitterly after some days I decided to go for a walk on my way coming back I bump 
             into four groups of girls who were looking for a teacher to teach them how to create a website this girls
              were in their year 2 just like me their names were kammy, bami, ola and funke. So I quickly offered to teach
               them and then I get paid they all agreed so it got to a point ola said to me sir isn't it better you do it 
               and get paid at that point I felt loved then I was taking to the vice chancellor of the school to show him
                my work, my design the man out of his love and care he gave me a reward of 50 thousand naira  and also
                 offered me a job in his school to show me more appreciation.
            As I worked temporarily during the students week of the university I was among the lecturers that was given
             award for their contribution in his University, at this point in my life I really wished Micheal was there with
              me to experience his hard work, to my greatest surprise ola was Micheal's cousin.
            As soon as I heard that ola was Micheal's cousin I rushed out for her and gave her a warm hug and gladly told her
             to please give me Micheal's number that I would like to speak with him so ola said no problem  I'll give you the
              number, after a while she came back, gave me the number I called the man and to my greatest surprise Micheal
               was in America with his  beautiful wife then I really thank him and told him all the news and 
               everything and then he wowed and congratulated me for picking up his advice after school and that 
               was how I became a CEO.
